# PathTracerWithCuda

A gpu accelerated path tracer based on CUDA

The compute capability of your GPU should be greater than 6.x(For unified memory has been widely used in my program)

A GREAT GPU IS ALWAYS BETTER FOR COMPLEX SCENES!

The GRAPHICS CARD'S DRIVER crashed occasionally. I am working on it. :(

* Interactive camera(Depth of field supported!)
* Interactive UI for modifying almost any stuff dynamically.
* Scene and configuration are defined using json syntax. Easy to use.
* Render scene could be modified dynamically.
* Diffuse and specular texture for any format.
* Obj mesh supported(You can define materials of each group).
* Subsurface scattering.
* Bvh accelerating structure.
* Skybox.
* Microfacet model for reflection.
